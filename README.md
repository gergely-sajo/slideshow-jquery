# Slideshow

## Purpose
My first project. With this simple application images can be viewed. One image can be seen at a time, but users can switch between images. The switch is automated with the slideshow.

## Functionalities
### Nex, previous images
Users can go the next or to the previous image by clicking one of the buttons.

### Slideshow
The switch to the next image can be automated by clicking the start slideshow button. When we get to the last image, the slideshow will automatically go to the first image and start over the process. With the stop slideshow button users can stop the slideshow.
